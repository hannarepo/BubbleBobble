MemoBubble is our version of the retro game “Bubble Bobble”. If you’re familiar with the original game, then you basically already know the core idea of this game: shooting bubbles at enemies, popping bubbles, collecting items to get points, passing levels... We do have our own twist though. There’s a shop where you can buy powerups, 3 different level themes (33 levels in total) reflecting the 2000s Frutiger aero aesthetic, special bubbles with different features, a softer palette, exciting lore, etc.
